# showerthoughts-dataset
Dataset repository for the paper [Investigating Wit, Creativity, and Detectability of Large Language Models in Domain-Specific Writing Style Adaptation of Reddit’s Showerthoughts](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VAYdzStvFj).

Our work was performed using a large dataset of the r/Showerthoughts Reddit community, which was provided via the Pushshift API service.
Unfortunately, Reddit has changed their terms in the course of 2023, restricting access to their data as well as to the Pushshift service.
Please note that we therefore do not provide a download link for original Reddit data in this repository, but only our AI-generated Showerthoughts.
If you would like to receive access to the full dataset, please follow the instructions provided in the separate readme file.
