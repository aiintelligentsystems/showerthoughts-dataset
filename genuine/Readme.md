# Instructions

Thank you for your interest in our Showerthoughts dataset.

The data that we use only ranges until the end of 2022 and was available to obtain via the Pushshift API without restrictions in early 2023.
However, in order to respect Redditâ€™s new Terms of Use that introduced restrictions to using their data in 2023, we are not publishing a download link for the original Showerthoughts data extracted from Reddit.
Instead, we ask you to contact the authors of this repository and briefly describe what you are planning to do with the data.
We will review your request and provide further information on how to access the dataset.

Best,
The authors
